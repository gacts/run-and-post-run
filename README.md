[Linked GitHub issue][community_issue].

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  run-some-action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run this action
        uses: gacts/run-and-post-run@v1
        with:
          run: echo "First"
              "(can be multiline)"
          post: |
            echo "First post"
            echo "(can run multiply commands)"
            ls -la /tmp \
              /bin /opt

      - name: Post command only
        uses: gacts/run-and-post-run@v1
        with:
          post: echo "Second post"
```

## Releasing

To release a new version:

- Build the action distribution (`make build` or `npm run build`).
- Commit and push changes (including `dist` directory changes - this is important) to the `master|main` branch.
- Publish the new release using the repo releases page (the git tag should follow the `vX.Y.Z` format).

Major and minor git tags (`v1` and `v1.2` if you publish a `v1.2.Z` release) will be updated automatically.
